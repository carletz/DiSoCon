# ‚òÄÔ∏è Differential Solar Controller ‚Äì 2025

This project is a modular **differential solar thermal controller** designed for systems with multiple thermal storage tanks. It supports:
- A **primary pump** for the solar panels
- A **3-way valve** to switch between **two storage tanks**
- A **secondary pump** for an additional tank, in my case the one heated by a normal gas boiler
- A **final 3-way valve** to manage recirculation between solar tank and normal hot water

The controller is designed to operate autonomously based on temperature differentials and includes logic protection features like anti-freeze and overheat modes.

## üß© System Architecture

### 1. Temperature Module (V1.1)
- Interfaces with up to 4 PT1000 temperature sensors and DS18B20 probes for others temperature. The PT1000 are designed for the solar panels, tank and normal hot water
- Provides real-time thermal data for control logic

### 2. Control Logic (V3.2)
- Based on a microcontroller (ESP32-S3)
- Controls triacs for pumps and relays valves (check your voltage and characteristic based on your system, this one is designed for a normal 230V power supply)
- Accepts analog/digital inputs (buttons, override switches, etc.)
- Manages logic for differential temperature thresholds, hysteresis, timing, and safety

### 3. Power Board (V2.0)
- Drives relays and triacs for high-current devices
- Features optoisolated inputs and snubber circuits
