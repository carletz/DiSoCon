# ☀️ Differential Solar Controller – 2025

This project is a modular **differential solar thermal controller** designed for systems with multiple thermal storage tanks. It supports:
- A **primary pump** for the solar panels
- A **3-way valve** to switch between **two storage tanks**
- A **secondary pump** for an additional tank, in my case the one heated by a normal gas boiler
- A **final 3-way valve** to manage recirculation between solar tank and normal hot water

The controller is designed to operate autonomously based on temperature differentials and includes logic protection features like anti-freeze and overheat modes.

## 🕰️ Project History

I have a solar panel system that generates hot water at home in the warm months. 
The current controller is a classic type without any type of integration with home automation control systems. The system works great but it was time for me to make it smart...

I decided to take inspiration from the manual of my controller, from a triac control of 230V motors, and from a PT1000 probe reader, like the one I currently have installed on the panels and cannot remove or replace. 
For this reason this project was born and now, in the final stages of testing, I would like to share it for inspiration or comments.
